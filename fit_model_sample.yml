# in the following we define the hypergraph convolution model, which has three parts, namely:
# 1) graph convolution layers: specified by a list of dicts, with each dict giving
#    the input and output dimensions of the hedge and node features; if output dimensions are
#    not specified they are taken to be equal to the corresponding input
